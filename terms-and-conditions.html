You may browse the Website without registering for an Account, but, to submit an Order, you must register for an Account.</p>
                                <p>4.2 If you have an Account: If you already have an Account, you can login to your Account to submit an Order.</p>

You can provide us with that information by filling in the necessary information on the Website manually where indicated and then following the instructions on the Website.</p>
                                <p>4.4 Registering for an Account: Once you register for an Account, you will be asked to create a username and password for your Account.

You acknowledge that any person to whom your username or password is disclosed is authorised to act as your agent for the purposes of using (and/or transacting via) your Account.

                                <p>4.5 Valid email address: You must be registered for an Account with a valid email address that you access regularly, so that, amongst other things, we can send administration and information emails to you.

However (subject to Clause 18.3 or Clause 19.3 (as applicable)), we shall not have any Liability for any delays or failures to accurately perform our obligations:</p>
                                <p>6.9.1 if we have used those endeavours; or</p>

This might happen if, for example, your website (in respect of which you use the Services):</p>
                                <p>7.12.1 has been hacked (such as through bugs in commonly-used software including WordPress);</p>
                                <p>7.12.2 contains malware;</p>
                                <p>7.12.3 is attacked (including by a denial of service attack); and/or</p>
                                <p>7.12.4 is badly coded.</p>
                                <p>7.12.5 attacks other clients their site.</p>

                                <p>7.13 Removal of Material: We reserve the right, and have absolute discretion, but not an obligation, to remove, screen or edit any content (including Material) that breaches this Agreement or is otherwise objectionable. Without prejudice to any other provision of this Agreement, we reserve the right to immediately remove any Material to which we object and/or if you are otherwise making inappropriate use of the Services contrary to the requirements of this Agreement.</p>

However, since we do not guarantee that the Services will be free from faults, we shall provide support accessed by means of a ticketing system available through your Account for you to use for us to deal with any faults and also for answering queries (“Support Services”).

                                <p>13.1 You can always end this Agreement: If you are a Consumer and, in some cases, if you are a Business Customer, your rights when you end this Agreement (or cancel any Service) will depend on what Services you have purchased from us, whether there is anything wrong with the Services, how we are performing and when you decide to end this Agreement (or cancel any Service):</p>
                                <p>13.1.1 if the Services are faulty or misdescribed you may have a legal right to end this Agreement (or to get the relevant Services re-performed or to get some or all of your money back), see Clause 16;</p>

                                <p>13.2 Ending this Agreement because of something we have done or are going to do: If you are ending this Agreement (or cancelling any Service) for a reason set out in Clauses 13.2.1 to 13.2.5, this Agreement (or that Service) will end immediately and we will refund you in full for the Services which have not been provided and you may also be entitled to compensation. The reasons are:</p>
                                <p>13.2.1 we have told you about an upcoming change to the Services, these General Terms (or a Schedule) or the Fees which you do not agree to (see Clauses 1.3, 6.7 and 10.3);</p>
                                <p>13.2.2 we have told you about an error in the price or description of the Services you have ordered and you do not wish to proceed;</p>

                                <p>13.2.4 we have suspended provision of the Services for technical reasons, or notify you we are going to suspend them for technical reasons, in each case for a period of more than one month; or</p>

Please note that you do not have a right to change your mind in respect of the Services listed in Clause 17.3.</p>
                                <p>13.4 Ending this Agreement where we are not at fault and there is no right to change your mind: If you do not have any other rights to end this Agreement (see Clause 13.1), you can still contact us and tell us you want to end it, or cancel any Service. This Agreement (or the relevant Service) will not end until the end of the then current calendar month in which you notify us that you want to end this Agreement (or the relevant Service). We will not refund any advance payment you have made for Services which will not be provided to you except to the extent required by law or otherwise agreed to by you.</p>

                                <p>We are a Nominet Registrar and as such may provide you with a domain name via Nominet. Please be aware that by registering a .uk domain name, you are bound by Nominet’s Terms and Conditions https://www.nominet.org.uk/uk-domain-names/registering-uk-domain/legal-details/terms-and-conditions-domain-name-registration</p>
                                
                                <p>All non-UK domains are provisioned through our registrar partner OpenSRS / Tucows Domains. As such we cannot guarantee the availability of a particular domain, however any charges incurred in the registration of a domain which is subsequently found to be unavailable will be refunded in full.</p>
                                
                                <p>Both UK and non-UK domains are provisioned through third-party registrars.</p>
                                
                                <p>Please note that the registrars may reject the registration of a domain if invalid information is provided at the time of order. All TLDs and ccTLDs have differing validation requirements which are also subject to change. As such we are not responsible for the validation of such data and it is your responsibility to check that a domain registration has been completed by the receipt of a ‘domain registration confirmation’ email. In the unlikely event a domain is rejected by the registrar, you will not receive such an email and we would need to be alerted to investigate this with the registrar directly and process the registration manually.</p></div>

                                <p>For Shared Hosting accounts, email storage shall not exceed the 10GB limit.</p>

                                <p>Upgrade to VPS / Elastic Cloud</p>
                                <p>Each hosting account can be upgraded to a VPS (Virtual Private Server) or the Elastic Cloud. The upgrade is performed by NMHosting.EU after You have paid the first month fee. The fee depends on the VPS type chosen by You and is non- refundable. Prorate amount for unused time of the shared hosting account will not be refunded, it will be added to Your account balance in the event of upgrade to VPS. Once the account is transferred to the VPS the Virtual hosting account is terminated and the new VPS account use is governed by the following terms.</p>
                                
                                <p>Certain situations may deem an upgrade to a VPS, in order to move an account, or service away from services or servers shared by others, such as excessive resource consumption.</p>
                                
                                
                                <p>IPv4 Usage Policy</p>
                                <p>Due to the exhaustion of the IPv4 address space we actively conserve IP address space by limiting the IP addresses each web hosting account can use.</p>
                                
                                <p>Shared hosting accounts may each use only 1 IP address.</p>
                                
                                <p>Reseller hosting accounts may use up to 10 IP addresses. The number of IPs that are included and the account may use up to are indicated in the plan specification.</p>
                                
                                <p>The IP address limit is a per account, not a per customer basis. Customers may hold multiple accounts to get access to additional IP addresses. We strongly urge customers to only use IP addresses for essential use and we do require justification for usage.</p>
                                
                                <p>The provision of additional IP addresses will be chargable.</p>
                                
                                
                                <p>VPS Fair Usage</p>
                                <p>Use of Traffic (Bandwidth).</p>
                                
                                <p>Your account monthly traffic may be limited in accordance with the VPS Type. The additional bandwidth is paid and applied on a monthly basis. The fee is non-refundable. If the monthly traffic limit is reached before the end of the month Your account will be suspended until the beginning of the next month.</p>
                                
                                <p>Disk Space Usage.</p>
                                
                                <p>Your account disk space is limited in accordance with the VPS Type. Up to 4 GB from the disc space is allocated to the VPS system files and this space cannot be used for storing Your content.</p>
                                
                                <p>Additional Services.</p>
                                
                                <p>The initial and renewal fees for each VPS include the number of IPs in accordance with VPS type. Additional IPs can be added to a VPS. In such a case NMHosting.EU will charge the appropriate fee for the dedicated IP. The fee is applied and should be paid on a per month basis. The fee is non-refundable.</p>
                                
                                <p>You can order Additional RAM as extra features to Your VPS account(s). NMHosting.EU will charge the appropriate fee for the additional RAM, depending on the amount of RAM ordered. The fee is applied and paid on a monthly basis. The fee is non-refundable. Renewal fee is due for the Additional RAM each month after the initial order, until the upgrade or the VPS account itself is cancelled. You are solely responsible to make the renewal payments in a timely manner. In case no renewal payment is received, NMHosting.EU will remove the additional RAM or will suspend the whole VPS account until receiving additional RAM renewal payment.</p>
                                
                                <p>VPS Servers are not included in r daily, or weekly backups. We strongly encourage you utilise a remote backup facility in the case of data-loss of corruption which may be irretrievable. NMHosting.EU cannot be held liable for the loss of data within a VPS.</p>

							  <div class="tab-pane fade" id="pills-sla" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="pills-sla-tab"><p>The objective of this SLA is to document the availability of the Service that NMHosting.EU  is to achieve. This does not constitute any additional liability to NMHosting.EU, but instead a self-assumed obligation towards the Client. Under the conditions below NMHosting.EU offers to pay the Client service credits if the availability defined below is not met.</p>

                                <p>NMHosting.EU shall guarantee the availability will be 99.9% in any calendar month, subject to exclusions as defined below. If NMHosting.EU fails to meet this guarantee a credit shall be available to the Client as defined below.</p>
                                
                                <p>The availability calculation shall exclude periods when outages arise from, or are otherwise indirectly caused by:</p>
                                
                                <p>– Outage periods due to any cause other than faults by NMHosting.EU, including faults or negligence of the Client or problems associated with equipment connected on the Client’s side of NMHosting.EU delivery point,</p>
                                
                                <p>– In case that the Client’s equipment should cause negative effects on the performance, quality and/or operation of the NMHosting.EU Network, NMHosting.EU will proceed to disconnect the link, for benefit of the rest of users of the NMHosting.EU Network. This disconnection won’t be cause of penalty under the SLA. NMHosting.EU will notify the Client as soon as possible about this issue in order for the Client to repair the problems.</p>
                                
                                <p>– Outage periods reported by the Client in which no fault is observed or confirmed by NMHosting.EU,</p>
                                
                                <p>– Any fault period during which service is suspended under provision in this Agreement,</p>
                                
                                <p>– The Client requesting NMHosting.EU to upgrade the capacity of the service, if this operation results in an outage.</p>
                                
                                <p>– During Scheduled Maintenance affecting the Services as defined above.</p>
                                
                                <p>– Performance degradations and service loss due to Denial Of Service attacks or other unlawful attacks generated inside the Client’s network or executed against users inside the Client’s network or the Client network infrastructure, will be excluded from SLA calculation as it is within the Client’s responsibility to put in place the relevant protection mechanisms inside its network to protect itself and its clients.</p>
                                
                                <p>Neither Party will be obliged to carry out any obligation under this Agreement where performance of such obligation is prevented by the occurrence of a Force Majeure Event. No commitment from NMHosting.EU applies in case of Force Majeure.</p>
                                
                                <p>Should the Client not have access to the Services as defined above, NMHosting.EU shall credit the client as follows:</p>
                                
                                <p>(a) <100% and > 99.8% = 5% monthly credit</p>
                                
                                <p>(b) 95% to 99.8% = 10% monthly credit</p>
                                
                                <p>(c) 90% to 94.9% = 25% monthly credit</p>
                                
                                <p>(d) 60% to 89.9% = 40% monthly credit</p>
                                
                                <p>(e) < 60% = Pro-rata up to a maximum of 100% monthly credit</p>
                                
                                <p>The credit applies to the contracted service. The Client shall not be entitled to any credits under this SLA if any payment of the price for the Services is overdue under the terms of this Agreement. The credit shall be made for the element of the Services that were not available, it will not be made for the whole service. (E.G. If a dedicated server and backup service are ordered, but the backup service is not available for a period of time, the credit will be calculated based on the price of the backup service, not the combined price of the dedicated server and backup service.) Any credit is subject to the Client notifying NMHosting.EU within 7 days in writing. This Client agrees the service credits due under this SLA are its sole remedy against NMHosting.EU for any non-availability of the Services.</p></div>
